	        The Crowd Navigation system aims to allow visually impaired users gain assistance in navigation (and other tasks) using crowdsourced assistance.<br>
	        The system is under development and this site is part of the testing grounds.<br>
	        <br>
	        A conceptual demo can be found by clicking the button below. Rather than a live streamed source, it will play a looped video.<br>
	        If multiple users log into the demo page, their directions (given by the arrow keys) will be aggregated and displayed.<br>
	        This should be used to gain a general concept of the system even though the end result is expected to be significantly different.<br>
	        Note that our system uses Google App Engine and a Google account is required to log in and use the demo.<br>
	        <form action="/demo">
                <input type="submit" value="Conceptual Demo">
            </form>
            The following button leads to the development version of the system.<br>
            As this is being used in the testing and development, this page could be in any state.<br>

	            <input type="submit" value="Development Version">
