		            <h3>Introduction</h3>
		            <p>The Crowd Navigation system aims to allow visually impaired users gain assistance in navigation (and other tasks) using crowdsourced assistance. The system is under development and this site is part of the testing grounds. Please note that the video streaming system uses WebRTC, which is currently only supported by the Chrome and Firefox browsers. However, WebRTC is currently being drafted as a W3C standard, so more browsers will likely support it soon.</p>
		            <h3>Demo</h3>
		            <p>A conceptual demo can be found by clicking the demo button. Rather than a live streamed source, it will play a looped video. If multiple users log into the demo page, their directions (given by the arrow keys) will be aggregated and displayed. This should be used to gain a general concept of the system even though the end result is expected to be significantly different. Note that our system uses Google App Engine and a Google account is required to log in and use the demo.</p>
		            <h3>Create Room</h3>
		            <p>The create room button will create a live stream from your browser. This can be run from a Chrome browser on an Android mobile device. Currently, there is no feedback to the streaming user.</p>
		            <h3>Development</h3>
		            <p>The development button leads to the development version of the system. As this is being used in the testing and development, this page could be in any state.</p>
